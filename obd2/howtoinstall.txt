These steps are mostly untested, might be missing something, should be mostly complete though.
As we say, "works on my machine" :-)

Prerequisites : python3, expect, php, and of course a bluetooth stack, bluetooth adapter and bluetooth OBD2 adapter.

1) Create a folder named /home/SMEG/obd2
2) Copy the files in the "scripts" folder into /home/SMEG/obd2
3) echo "www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /home/SMEG/obd2/" > /etc/sudoers.d/obd2
4) Copy the files in the www folder into your own www folder
5) Run those commands, replacing WWWOBD2FOLDER with the full path of where you installed obd2.php :

mkdir WWWOBD2FOLDER/tmp
echo "tmpfs           WWWOBD2FOLDER/tmp tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0" >> /etc/fstab
ln -s WWWOBD2FOLDER/tmp /home/SMEG/obd2/tmp
echo "
mkdir WWWOBD2FOLDER/tmp/obd2
chown www-data:www-data WWWOBD2FOLDER/tmp/obd2
ln -s WWWOBD2FOLDER/tmp/obd2 /tmp/obd2
" >> /etc/rc.local

6) Add a href link to the file obd2.php to access it from the SMEG
7) In the connect-obd.sh script, search for "rfcomm connect" and change the MAC to your own adapter's mac.
